      " Development \n",
      "Super Mario Bros., the successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both of whom belonged to Nintendo's Creative Department, and largely programmed by Toshihiko Nakago of SRD Company, Ltd. Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by \"a grand culmination\" of their technical knowledge from previous games such as Excitebike, Devil World, and Kung Fu, by a desire to give the ROM cartridge format \"a final exclamation point\" in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System as the new dominant medium, and by continuing their legacy in the platform game genre. Miyamoto explained, \"We felt strongly about how we were the first to come up with [what we called the \"athletic game\"] genre, and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it. ... We had built up a lot of know-how since the release of the console, and the time had come when that would be possible.\" The game was made in tandem with The Legend of Zelda, another Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto, which was released in Japan five months after Super Mario Bros. As a result, certain elements were carried over from The Legend of Zelda to Super Mario Bros; for instance, the fire bars that appear in the game's castle levels began as an unused object from Zelda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development was aimed at simplicity in order to have a new game available for the end-of-year shopping season. They started with a prototype in which the player simply moves a 16 by 32 pixel square around a single screen. Tezuka suggested the use of Mario after seeing the sales figures of Mario Bros., which was still selling well throughout the previous year. The team chose to name the game \"Super Mario Bros.\" after deciding to implement the Super Mushroom into the game. The game initially made use of a concept in which Mario or Luigi could enter a rocket ship and drive it around while firing at enemies, but this went unused; the final game's sky-based bonus stages are a remnant of this concept. After releasing Mario Bros., the team had reflected that it had been an illogical gameplay decision for Mario to be hurt by stomping upon the walking turtles, so they decided that any future Mario game would \"definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want.\" When designing King Koopa, Miyamoto initially imagined the character as an ox, taking inspiration from the character design of the Ox King the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great. However, when Tezuka saw Miyamoto's design for the character, he noted that it looked more akin to that of a turtle, prompting the two to work on defining and fleshing out the character's design until coming up with his final appearance.2009-08-11\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of Super Mario Bros. is an early example of specialization in the video game industry, made possible and necessary by the Famicom's arcade-capable hardware. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music, and sound effects. Developers of previous hit games joined the team, importing many special programming techniques, features, and design refinements such as these: \"Donkey Kongs slopes, lifts, conveyor belts, and ladders; Donkey Kong Jr.s ropes, logs and springs; and Mario Bros.s enemy attacks, enemy movement, frozen platforms and POW Blocks\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version. Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a power-up. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in the first level of the game, the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released. The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\". The team also deliberately chose not to have Mario begin levels as Super Mario in order to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying for the player. Miyamoto explained: \"When we made the prototype of the big Mario, we did not feel he was big enough. So, we came up with the idea of showing the smaller Mario first, who could be made bigger later in the game; then players could see and feel that he was bigger.\" A rumor stemming from a Japanese magazine claimed that the developers came up with the idea to include a small Mario after a bug in the game caused only the upper-half of his body to appear, but this claim has been disavowed by Miyamoto. Miyamoto said the shell-kicking 1-up trick was intentionally designed and carefully tested, but \"people turned out to be a lot better at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought\". Other features, such as blocks containing multiple coins, were inspired by programming glitches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super Mario Bros. was developed for a 256-kilobit cartridge. Due to this storage limitation, the designers happily considered their aggressive search for space-saving opportunities to be akin to their own fun television game show competition. For instance, clouds and bushes in the game's backgrounds use that same sprite recolored. Sound effects were also recycled; the sound when Mario is damaged is the same as when he enters a pipe, and Mario jumping on an enemy is the same sound as each stroke when swimming. After completing the game, the development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy rather than beginning the game with Koopa Troopas. By this point, the project had nearly run out of memory, so the designers created the Goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation. After the addition of the game's music, around 20 bytes of open cartridge space remained.

      "thumb|right|upright=.8|Koji Kondo created all the music and sound effects for the game\n",
      "\n",
      "Nintendo sound designer Koji Kondo wrote the six-track score for Super Mario Bros., as well as all of the game's sound effects. At the time he was composing, video game music was mostly meant to attract attention, not necessarily to enhance or conform to the game. Kondo's work on Super Mario Bros. was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games. Kondo had two specific goals for his music: \"to convey an unambiguous sonic image of the game world\", and \"to enhance the emotional and physical experience of the gamer\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The music of Super Mario Bros. is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites, which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion. Kondo wasn't the first to do this in a video game; for instance, Space Invaders features a simple song that gets faster and faster as the aliens speed up, eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game. However, Kondo attempted to take the idea further, stating that the primary question determining the use of a game's music was \"Do the game and music fit one another?\" (Order No. MR84768). Unlike most games at the time, for which composers were hired later in the process to add music to a nearly finished game, Kondo was a part of the development team almost from the beginning of production, working in tandem with the rest of the team to create the game's soundtrack. Kondo's compositions were largely influenced by the game's gameplay, intending for it to \"heighten the feeling of how the game controls\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Before composition began, a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario's general environment and revolve the music around it. Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit the game's environments. After the development of the game showed progress, Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game, so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs' tempos.  The music was further adjusted based on the expectations of Nintendo's play-testers.\n",

      "Super Mario Bros. was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the Family Computer. It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its exact North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; though generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a launch game, several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986. The game was released in Europe two years later on May 15, 1987 for the NES.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1988, the game was re-released along with the shooting range game Duck Hunt as part of a single ROM cartridge, which came packaged with the NES as a pack-in game, as part of the console's Action Set. This version of the game is extremely common in North America, with millions of copies of it having been manufactured and sold in the United States. In 1990, another cartridge, touting the two games as well as World Class Track Meet, was also released in North America as part of the NES Power Set. It was released on May 15, 1987 in Europe, and during that year in Australia as well. In 1988, the game was re-released in Europe in a cartridge containing the game plus Tetris and Nintendo World Cup. The compilation was sold alone or bundled with the revised version of the NES.\n",

The version of Super Mario Bros. included in this compilation has improved graphics and sound to match the SNES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations to some of the game's collision mechanics. The game also features the ability for a player to save their progress midway through the game and changes the game's multiplayer mode so that the two players switch off after every level in addition to whenever a player dies.

It is compatible with the Game Boy Printer. Compared to Super Mario Bros., the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Color.\n",

      "In early 2003, Super Mario Bros. was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a part of the Famicom Minis collection in Japan and as a part of the NES Series in the US. This version of the game is entirely emulated, making it completely identical to the original game. According to the NPD Group (which tracks game sales in North America), this re-released version of Super Mario Bros. was the best-selling Game Boy Advance game from June 2004 to December 2004. In 2005, Nintendo re-released this port of the game as a part of the game's 20th Anniversary; this special edition of the game went on to sell approximately 876,000 units.\n",

      "Super Mario Bros. is featured as one of the 30 included games with the NES Classic Edition, a dedicated video game console containing several NES games.

The release is a complete emulation of the original game, meaning that nothing is changed from the its original NES release.

      "Super Mario Bros. was immensely successful and helped popularize side-scrolling platform games. Altogether, excluding ports and rereleases, the original NES version of the game has sold 40.24 million copies, making it the bestselling video game in the Mario series and one of the bestselling video games of all time, with 29 million copies sold in North America. The game was the all-time bestselling game for over 20 years until its lifetime sales were ultimately surpassed by Wii Sports. The game's Wii Virtual Console release was also successful, becoming the #1 selling game out of the service's lineup of games by mid-2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer Entertainer / Video Game Update magazine highly praised Super Mario Bros., writing that the game was worthy of \"a spot in the hall of fame reserved for truly addictive action games\", praising its \"cute and comical\" graphics and its lively music. It stated that the game was a must-have for the system, and considered its greatest strength to be its depth of play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retrospective critical analysis of the game has been extremely positive, with many touting it as one of the best video games of all-time.Sources calling Super Mario Bros. one of the all-time best games include these:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nintendo Power listed it as the fourth best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as the game that started the modern era of video games as well as \"Shigeru Miyamoto's masterpiece\". The game ranked first on Electronic Gaming Monthly \"Greatest 200 Games of Their Time\" list and was named in IGN top 100 games of all-time list twice, in 2005 and 2007. In 2009, Game Informer put Super Mario Bros. in second place on its list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", behind The Legend of Zelda, saying that it \"remains a monument to brilliant design and fun gameplay\". The Game Informer staff also ranked it the second best in their 2001 list of the top 100 games ever made. In 2012, G4 ranked Super Mario Bros. first of the \"Top 100 Video Games of All Time\", citing its revolutionary gameplay as well as its role in helping recover the NA gaming industry from the Video Game Crash of 1983. In 2014, IGN ranked Super Mario Bros. as the best Nintendo game in their \"Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time\" list, saying that \"this is the most important Nintendo game ever made\". In a poll held by IGN in 2005, the game was ranked number one in the website's list of the 100 greatest video games of all-time. In 2017, Polygon ranked the game #8 out of the core Super Mario games, crediting the game with \"kick[ing] off this franchise's habit of being an exception to so many rules\". In 2018, Business Insider included the game as number 2 in their list of the top 10 Super Mario games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several critics have praised the game for its precise controls, which allow the player to control how high and far Mario or Luigi jumps, and how fast he runs. AllGame gave Super Mario Bros. a five-star rating, stating that \"[T]he sense of excitement, wonder and – most of all – enjoyment felt upon first playing this masterpiece of videogame can't barely be put into words.

Reviewing the Virtual Console Release of the game, IGN called it \"an absolute must for any gamer's Virtual Console collection.\" Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life called the game's visuals \"unavoidably outdated\" compared to newer games, but mused that they were impressive at the time that the game was released.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game Boy Advance port of Super Mario Bros. holds an aggregate score of 84 on Metacritic. Many critics compared the port to previous ports of the game such as Super Mario Deluxe and Super Mario All-Stars, noting its comparative lack of brand new content to separate it from the original version of the game. Jeremy Parish of 1up.com called the game \"The most fun you'll ever have while being robbed blind,\" ultimately giving the game a score of 80% and praising its larger-scaling screen compared to Deluxe while greatly criticizing its lack of new features. IGN Craig Harris labeled the game as a \"must-have,\" but also mused \"just don't expect much more than the original NES game repackaged on a tiny GBA cart.\"\n",
      "GameSpot gave the port a 6.8 out of 10, generally praising the gameplay but musing that the port's graphical and technical differences from the original version of the game \"prevent this reissue from being as super as the original game.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game Boy Color port of the game also received wide critical appraisal; IGN Craig Harris gave Super Mario Bros. Deluxe a perfect score, praising it as a perfect translation of the NES game. He hoped that it would be the example for other NES games to follow when being ported to the Game Boy Color. GameSpot gave the game a 9.9, hailing it as the \"killer app\" for the Game Boy Color and praising the controls and the visuals (it was also the highest rated game in the series, later surpassed by Super Mario Galaxy 2 which holds a perfect 10). Both gave it their Editors' Choice Award. Allgame Colin Williamson praised the porting of the game as well as the extras, noting the only flaw of the game being that sometimes the camera goes with Mario as he jumps up. Nintendo World Report Jon Lindemann, in 2009, called it their \"(Likely) 1999 NWR Handheld Game of the Year,\" calling the quality of its porting and offerings undeniable. Nintendo Life gave it a perfect score, noting that it retains the qualities of the original game and the extras. St. Petersburg Times Robb Guido commented that in this form, Super Mario Bros. \"never looked better.\" The Lakeland Ledger Nick S. agreed, praising the visuals and the controls. In 2004, a Game Boy Advance port of Super Mario Bros. (part of the Classic NES Series) was released, which had none of the extras or unlockables available in Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Of that version, IGN noted that the version did not \"offer nearly as much as what was already given on the Game Boy Color\" and gave it an 8.0 out of 10. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe ranked third in the best-selling handheld game charts in the U.S. between June 6 and 12, 1999 and sold over 2.8 million copies in the U.S. It was included on Singapore Airlines flights in 2006.

      "The success of ''Super Mario Bros.'' led to the development of many successors in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', an entry in the series and the first to take place in a three-dimensional environment, is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D.

      "The success of Super Mario Bros. led to the development of many successors in the Super Mario series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater Mario franchise. Two of these sequels, Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3, were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of Super Mario All-Stars under the name Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. The gameplay concepts and elements established in Super Mario Bros. are prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one Super Mario game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date.

The series is one of the best-selling, with over 310 million copies of games sold worldwide as of September 2015. In 2010, Nintendo released special red variants of the Wii and Nintendo DSi XL consoles in re-packaged, Mario-themed limited edition bundles as part of the 25th anniversary of the game's original release. To celebrate the series' 30th anniversary, Nintendo released Super Mario Maker, a game for the Wii U which allows players to create custom platforming stages using assets from Super Mario games and in the style of Super Mario Bros. along with other styles based around different games in the series.\n",
